# Introduction

This project seeks to provide "travel advice" based on laws and practical
safety within various jurisdictions.  It is not geared towards people
living in a state (laws, for instance, about medical insurance won't
generally be mentioned, as most people traveling will have
out-of-jurisdiction medical insurance. Likewise, laws about school
athletics will not be mentioned as these generally don't impact
travelers.  However, information that might impact travelers in
different situation will be mentioned. For instance, someone assigned to
a business project for several months in a state may need to utilize
medical care. Others may travel with children and be concerned about how
this could be seen as child abuse or cause child custody issues.
