<p>Scroll down on this page to "Directory of Jurisdictions" (right now it's
only USA, but in the future it'll have other countries) and click on the
country you are interested in.</p>

<h1 id="toc-2">DISCLAIMER</h1>

<p>This is not legal advice, and is not put together by a lawyer.  This
information is not guaranteed to be up-to-date or accurate.  You
should consult with an attorney with any questions.</p>

<h1 id="toc-3">Introduction</h1>

<p>This project seeks to provide "travel advice" based on laws and practical
safety within various jurisdictions.  It is not geared towards people
living in a state (laws, for instance, about medical insurance won't
generally be mentioned, as most people traveling will have
out-of-jurisdiction medical insurance. Likewise, laws about school
athletics will not be mentioned as these generally don't impact
travelers.  However, information that might impact travelers in
different situation will be mentioned. For instance, someone assigned to
a business project for several months in a state may need to utilize
medical care. Others may travel with children and be concerned about how
this could be seen as child abuse or cause child custody issues.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="toc-5">A Note on Intersectional Oppression</h1>

<p>This directory is focused on laws and safety concerns that generally
impact trans people. However, not all trans people have the same safety
concerns, which is why I've refrained from saying a state might be
"safe" or "dangerous" directly, or giving scores/grades/etc.  For
instance, a wealthy trans person may be able to more safely visit a
specific jurisdiction than someone without class privilege. Likewise, a
person with white privilege might be safe in a place where a person who
does not have that privilege might not.  The intent is to not erase
these legitimate intersectional concerns, but to be a starting point for
your research.</p>

<h1 id="toc-6">About "Bad Countries" and "Bad States"</h1>

<p>Trans people have always existed, and still do exist across all
cultures. A jurisdiction may be unsafe or have bad laws, but there will
still be trans people within that jurisdiction, and it's important to
consider them before fully writing off a state or country as not worth a
fight. In addition, there are accepting, open-minded allies in every
jurisdiction as well.</p>

<p>In addition, in both good and bad jurisdictions, there will be good and
bad treatment of trans people. The summaries in this project attempt to
summarize the situation for people, but they are just summaries. Any one
individual's situation may be different than what others face, both good
and bad.</p>

<h1 id="toc-7">Errors / Omissions</h1>

<p>This project welcomes contributions via pull requests or email to
jmaslak@antelope.net.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting is general information from people that know
the location, beyond just what the laws say. If you know a city has a
great neighborhood for trans people, or that there is a disparity
between how one area of the country or state treats people and another,
this is extremely valuable information!</p>

<p>This project also welcomes contributions of new jurisdictions!
To add a new jurisdiction, please utilize the template in template.md if

<p>Alabama has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

impact on child custody. However, this is currently stayed by judicial
order pending ongoing legislation.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 18 has passed and became law, but there is currently a
judicial stay preventing enforcement of this law for puberty blockers

beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>

as the age of majority in Alabama is 19) is illegal, in a law entitled
the "Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act."  This law
is blocked from enforcement (for the puberty blocker and hormone
therapy aspects) by court while litigation proceeds, but shows the
state's view of this care.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 5 in schools.</p>

<p>Birmingham has been called out as welcoming by a contributor ("hub of
all queerness"), and may be more welcoming than some other places.
Likewise, Mobile has also been noted for having Decadence, the first
Mardi Gras parade, the Prancing Elites, has the Fruit Loop which
includes on of the only lesbian bars in the country, and politicians and
organizations who have supported gay people historically.  That said,
municipalities have limited power and cannot override state laws.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

</section><section><h1 id="toc-11">USA - Arkansas</h1>

<p>Arkansas negative laws towards trans people. Some of these laws may
place trans people at risk. Trans people should particularly consider
the bathroom law. While it requires "arousing or gratifying a sexual
desire," how that will be enforced is a gray area.</p>

<p>Arkansas does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law that is not stayed by judicial order does not have parental
penalties and has some exceptions (when it goes into effect this summer).
However, it is unknown how this might have an impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Arkansas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Arkansas has banned local subdivisions from establishing inclusive
non-discrimination laws.</li>

education) employees will not be able to be disciplined for deadnaming
or misgendering intentionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>A law makes it a sex crime to use a bathroom other than the one
associated with your sex assigned at birth if a minor is present and
you are "arousing or gratifying a sexual desire". It is unknown how
this law will be utilized.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Arkansas.</li>
<li>Arkansas has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exposure of prosthetic genitals or breasts partial or
completely, during "performance" intended to appeal to "the prurient
interest" is illegal.  These do not need to be attached to a human
to be illegal. This applies in public and in any space where minors
may be.</li>

<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A 2023 law banning medical transition (with extremely narrow
exceptions) for people under 18 has passed and became law. This goes
into effect during summer of 2023.</li>
<li>There is a 2021 anti-trans youth medical ban but there is currently
a judicial stay preventing
enforcement of this law for puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
The 2023 law mentioned above is to get around this block.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care will be illegal (as of summer 2023) for youth in
Arkansas, although under current law that is not stayed, penalties
will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of

</ul>

<p>While California will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many

<p>However, much of Colorado is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the Denver/Boulder metro area where many people are visibly trans. That
said, attacks still can and do occur in Colorado.  However, rural areas
may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some jurisdictions
outside of the Denver/Boulder metro have attempted to restrict the rights
of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries.</p>

<p>Equality Florida, an LGBT advocacy group, has issued an advisory travel
warning for the State of Florida.</p>

<p>Florida has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction, although it is not yet (or
proposed to be under pending legislation) legally considered child
abuse.  Florida's youth care ban also allows the Florida courts to have
emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it is necessary in an emergency
to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or is
threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or
procedures," similar to how the courts have jurisdiction over abuse.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
include trans people.</li>
<li>Public school (K12) employees will not be able to be disciplined
after July 1, 2023 for using pronouns and titles associated a trans
person's sex assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Florida.</li>
<li>There is a "bathroom law" in Florida that takes effect on July 1, 2023.
This would make it a crime to use a bathroom in government facilities
(any level of government) not associated with your assigned sex at
birth, if anyone objected to your presence and you refused to
immediately leave. This also covers health care facilities, massage
parlors, jails, pharmacies, etc.</li>
<li>Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
drag performances where minors were present.</li>
<li>Florida has a "protection of children" law that bans "lewd conduct"
and similar activities outside of venues such as strip clubs that are
licensed for the purpose and only permit adults. This has been
labeled a drag ban, and depending on how courts interpret various
phrases may or may not actually be one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

This would make it a crime to use a bathroom in government facilities
(any level of government) not associated with your
assigned sex at birth, if anyone objected to your presence and you
refused to immediately leave.</li>
<li>This law would apply to airport bathrooms, so trans people and families
should use caution connecting through Florida airports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of July 1, 2023, trans women must be housed with men.</li>
<li>As of July 1, 2023, trans men must be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Local jails have housed at least one cis woman in men's jail after
mistaking her for a trans woman.</li>
<li>As public funds cannot be used for transition care, trans prisoners
will not have access to trans-related medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2023, Florida will define sex largely consistent with sex
assigned at birth for a large number of interactions trans travelers
may have. Birth certificates, IDs, genital configurations, etc, will
not take priority over sex assigned at birth.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults, but this is potentially at
risk and is subject to significant restriction.</li>
<li>Nurse practitioners and telehealth providers are not allowed to
provide HRT in Florida.</li>
<li>Medical transition for people under age 18 is illegal.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny most care on the basis of their religious
or ethical beliefs (emergency care is required to be provided).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Florida</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.  However, Florida's youth care ban also allows the
Florida courts to have emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it
is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child
has been subjected to or is threatened with being subjected to
sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures," similar to how the
courts have jurisdiction over abuse.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Equity Florida has issued a travel warning for the State of Florida (the
NAACP and LULAC, a Latino advocacy organization, have also done so,
for anti-Black and anti-Latino racism).</p>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools.</p>

<p>Some state officials consider exposure of children to sexual orientation or
gender identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Note that colonization disrupted Hawaiian culture significantly,

<p>Illinois recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men. However, while non-binary people
lack some recognition (for instance, until 2024, will be unable to get
an "X" marker on their license), most laws are positive and there is
non-discrimination protection for trans people.</p>

<p>Illinois is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Illinois non-discrimination laws.</li>
<li>Illinois has a religious freedom law that may provide religious exemptions
to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>

guards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
However, non-binary recognition is still in-complete in Illinois.
For example, "X" gender markers are not available on driver's licenses
in Illinois due to <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/25/20832644/pritzker-approves-non-binary-state-id-cards-drivers-licenses">bureaucratic reasons</a>
(the law allows this but the
company the state's current contract is with does not allow it).</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Illinois will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Illinois for medical transition.</li>
<li>There is a religious exemption law that applies to limited medical
situations in Illinois.</li>

<li>Illinois has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Illinois</li>

against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Illinois will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many

states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Illinois via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<p>Utah has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.</p>

<p>Utah does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).</p>

<p>Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from Utah's
and may lack some protections.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
many services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Utah</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="../notes/tsa.html">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are typically be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are typically be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized in limited ways.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Utah allows gender marker changes on IDs in some circumstances.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
providers). While the law itself does allow for the possibility of
hormone treatment of trans youth, in theory, the provisions are
extremely restrictive and place doctors at extreme financial risk,
resulting in this making it effectively a ban as any Utah provider would be
willing to take the risk of prescribing HRT or puberty blockers to
trans youth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.</li>
<li>Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
marriages.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,

trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Washington is one of the safer states for trans people in the United
States. This does not mean to expect full equality in all instances, but
the letter of the law is generally non-discriminatory. Sex and gender
are treated the same under WA state law.</p>

<p>Washington explicitly protects trans medical care, including for
children. Care providers and homes for runaway you are not required to
notify parents in most cases that children receive gender-affirming
care. Washington does have a sanctuary law.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

Department of Corrections. According to policy, they must take into
consider safety on a case-by-case basis, and as such, there is no

</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>By law, gender is based upon gender identity/expression, regardless
of assigned gender at birth.</li>

</section><section><h1 id="toc-60">Flying with the TSA (Transportation Security Agency)</h1>

<p>When flying out of USA airports (including after connecting from
international flights), security screening is required.  This is done by
the TSA.</p>

<p>TSA recommends that tickets booked for travel out of USA airports be
booked with a gender marker that matches the gender on the person's ID
they are using for travel.  However, it is not technically required, and
not all airlines implement the "X" gender marker yet.</p>

<p>Note if you are traveling internationally, you may be required to travel
with a ticket booked with the same gender as the passport you will be
using.</p>

<p>TSA utilizes body scanning technology for travelers not selected for
pre-check (see below).  When using this technology, at most airports,
the screener will hit a pink or blue button based on the anatomy and/or
gender they think the passenger has/is.  This may or may not match
gender expression.  This adjusts the machine to expect certain anatomy.
If the pink button is pushed, a penis will likely alert the TSA (it
won't say what is wrong, but will place a colored box on a cartoon
figure of a passenger indicating what needs to be patted down by the
TSA).  If they hit a blue button, breasts will likely alert.</p>

<p>Pat downs of these sensitive areas may be aggressive and triggering. You
have the right to ask for a private space and the screener of the
desired gender, although official policies may not always be followed.</p>

<p>Behavior seen as aggressive towards the TSA may result in criminal or
civil action, and you may not be allowed through security.</p>

<h2>Gender Mismatch with ID</h2>

<p>In the USA, you should generally not have problems with a gender
expression that does not match your ID.  Note this does not apply at
international destinations.</p>

<h2>Pre-Check</h2>

<p>If you travel frequently and have the money to enroll, you can enroll in
the "Pre-Check" (or "Global Entry" which includes pre-check) program.
This increases your chance of being selected for pre-check screening. If
your boarding pass indicates "pre-check", you can use dedicated
pre-check lanes at most airports, and typically these will require a
metal detector but not body scanner, making travel possibly less
triggering. </p>

<h2>Note about International Travel</h2>

<p>This only applies to travel from USA-airports.  If you fly
internationally, airports in other countries will have different
procedures. Pre-check is a USA program, and does not apply outside the
USA.</p>

<h1 id="toc-61">Airport Bathrooms</h1>

<p>Regulations around bathrooms will generally match those of public
accommodations in the city/state the airport is in, which doesn't
necessarily match the name the airport uses for itself.  Some US airports
may be in states you don't expect (Examples: Cincinnati's airport is in
Kentucky, while Kansas City's airport is on the Missouri side of the
border).</p>

<p>It is legal for all people to use non-gendered bathrooms.  Major
airports typically will have a non-gendered bathroom (perhaps labeled as
a family bathroom).</p>
