# Airport Bathrooms

Regulations around bathrooms will generally match those of public
accommodations in the city/state the airport is in, which doesn't
necessarily match the name the airport uses for itself.  Some US airports
may be in states you don't expect (Examples: Cincinnati's airport is in
Kentucky, while Kansas City's airport is on the Missouri side of the
border).

It is legal for all people to use non-gendered bathrooms.  Major
airports typically will have a non-gendered bathroom (perhaps labeled as
a family bathroom).
