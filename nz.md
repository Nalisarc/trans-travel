# Aotearoa / New Zealand

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of Aotearoa / NZ law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to Aotearoa / NZ, I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

The LGBT community may be referred to as the "rainbow community" here.

## Summary

While Aotearoa / NZ does not specifically name trans people in non-discrimination
law, they appear to be protected under the 1993 Human Rights Act, under
the grounds of "sex" discrimination.

Aotearoa / NZ does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * While the 1993 Human Rights Act does not specifically name trans
   people, it is believed to protect against anti-trans discrimination
   in the same ways it protects against sex discrimination.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people can use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. Note
   however that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
   However, a trans person can use a toilet that best fits their
   identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Aotearoa / NZ does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of Aotearoa / NZ will require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women can be housed with women, except if they have been
   convicted of sexual offenses against women. This is subject to prison
   service approval.
 * Trans men can be housed with men, except if they have been
   convicted of sexual offenses against men. This is subject to prison
   service approval.
 * Nonbinary people's prison assignment is based upon prison service
   approval.

## Legal Definition of Sex

People can self-declare their gender, including "M", "F", or "X" on
passports, birth certificates, and other legal documents.  The birth
certificate is commonly used as proof of sex for activities such as
school or prison.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Surgical care for some procedures is unavailable in New Zealand.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not considered child abuse.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Human Rights Act of 1993](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_Human+Rights+Act+1993_resel_25_a&p=1%2f)

## General Safety

Aotearoa / NZ is a country with a variety of different cultures. Some of
these cultures have a long heritage of people who [do not fit the gender
binary](https://teara.govt.nz/en/gender-diversity/page-4), but others are
more resistant to trans people, in some cases due to the impact of
colonization. Trans people in Aotearoa / NZ face some discrimination, but
tend to face less violence than in the United States.

While there is a history of support for trans people, including the
[first openly trans minister of parliament in the
world](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/georgina-beyer-becomes-first-transgender-woman-elected-parliament),
recent world-wide "culture wars" have begun making some inroads into New
Zealand. While these are not predominant beliefs, and most residents
appear to reject them, some politicians have begun to [campaign on
transphobic policies](https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/08/17/exclude-trans-women-from-womens-bathrooms-threaten-sports-funding-nz-first/)
as of 2023. In addition, anti-trans protesters have been active, fueled
by international anti-trans hate, with [anti-trans hate rhetoric increasing in
2023](https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/08/posie-parker-kellie-jay-keen-minshull-anti-trans-online-hate/).
That said, at major hate events, counter-protesters (I.E. people supporting
trans rights) have, thus far (as of September, 2023), outnumbered hate
group members.

In general, more protections exist for trans people in Aotearoa / NZ
than in the United States, particularly around hate speech and
harassment. Like many places, larger cities are said to be more
accepting than some rural places, although trans visitors are generally
unlikely to directly encounter explicit, directed hate in any area of
the country.
