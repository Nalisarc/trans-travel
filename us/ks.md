# USA - Kansas

Kansas places trans people at risk by not recognizing any gender other
than sex assigned at birth, regardless of legal documentation changes in
Kansas or elsewhere.

Kansas does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Kansas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people

## Public Accommodations

 * Because of Kansas's law defining sex legally (note that the law does
   not mention bathrooms directly), it may be interpreted by courts, in
   combination with other laws, to ban trans people from appropriate
   bathrooms.
 * Some believe trans women are required to use male facilities such
   as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.
 * Some believe Trans men are required to use women's facilities such
   as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.
 * Some believe non-binary people are required to use facilities
   based on sex assigned at birth.
 * Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
   but it is unclear how that is reconciled with state law.

It is unknown how this would be enforced.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Currently, no ban on drag performance

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

 * It may be illegal to use a bathroom that does not match your sex
   assigned at birth in Kansas airports (note that Kansas City
   Airport - MCI - is in Missouri)

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would be required to be housed with men
 * Trans men would be required to be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would be required to be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * sex = "biological sex, either male or female, at birth"
 * female = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
   to produce ova"
 * male = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
   to fertilize the ova of a female"
 * woman = "human females"
 * girl = "human females"
 * man = "human male"
 * boy = "human male"

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people who are "born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of
'disorder/differences in sex development'" should be considered disabled
and provided accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 SB180 - Trans-exclusionary Definition of Sex](http://kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/documents/sb180_enrolled.pdf)

## General Safety

Some communities may be more welcoming than others. For instance,
Lawrence was indicated as a welcoming city.

Bathroom access may be a significant issue in Kansas.  Already, in May
2023, the same month the trans-exclusionary definition of sex was
enacted, a cis woman in a public library who was assisting her
non-verbal son use the bathroom was
[kicked out of the women's bathroom](https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/05/23/amid-anti-trans-law-kansas-woman-son-asked-to-leave-library-restroom/70245966007/),
which she believes is connected to SB180 (prior to the passage of SB180,
they had used the bathroom for years). The son's presence was also
objected to by another bathroom user in addition to library staff,
showing that this policing bathrooms is on the mind of Kansas citizens.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
