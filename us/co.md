# USA - Colorado

Colorado recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.

Colorado is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Colorado non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are safest in,
   including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Colorado.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While most jails/prisons have regulations that, in theory, would
   consider gender identity in housing decisions, these regulations are
   often ignored and trans people are often housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in Colorado.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in Colorado.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Colorado will not
   cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
   receiving care in Colorado for medical transition.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Colorado has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Colorado
 * Colorado will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Colorado will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Colorado via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

However, much of Colorado is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the Denver/Boulder metro area where many people are visibly trans. That
said, attacks still can and do occur in Colorado.  However, rural areas
may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some jurisdictions
outside of the Denver/Boulder metro have attempted to restrict the rights
of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries.
