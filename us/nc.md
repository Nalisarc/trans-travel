# USA - North Carolina

North Carolina does not have laws that target trans people directly.

North Carolina does not appear to place child custody at risk, although
the legislature (as of June 9, 2023) has an active bill that may pass
that would restrict some trans healthcare.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * North Carolina non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * North Carolina, famously, passed an anti-trans bathroom law that was later
   repealed. In a compromise, the repeal legislation prohibited any
   local non-discrimination ordinances from being passed up until 2020.
   That provision has since expired.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in North Carolina.

   inmates not already on HRT prior to incarceration to be prescribed HRT,
   denial of surgery, and inappropriate (wrong gender) housing.
 * An intersex prisoner alleges in a lawsuit that they contracted HIV
   due to inappropriate housing in a men's institution.

## Legal Definition of Sex

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * North Carolina does not appear to place child custody at risk, although
   the legislature (as of June 9, 2023) has an active bill that may pass
   that would restrict some trans healthcare.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized
 * Officials can excuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses on the
   basis of religious objections.

## Relevant Laws

 * [Session Law 2015-75 - Allowing Officials Religious Objections to Marriages](https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2015/Bills/Senate/PDF/S2v4.pdf)
 * [2023 H808 - Trans Youth Medical Ban Bill (not yet passed)](https://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H808/2023)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
