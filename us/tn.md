# USA - Tennessee

Tennessee has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.

South Dakota does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers), except possibly if one parent provides
hormones or puberty blockers without the other parent's consent.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Tennessee non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Tennessee municipalities are blocked from enacting laws that protect
   LGBT people.
 * Public school (K12) employees will not be able to be disciplined
   for using pronouns and titles associated a trans person's sex assigned
   at birth.

## Public Accommodations

   Tennessee.

   services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Tennessee has a "drag ban" law that prohibits "male or female
   impersonators" who perform on public property, in any location
   where a minor could potentially be present. This includes felony
   penalties for a second conviction.  However, this law is currently
   stayed (as of May 19, 2023), meaning it is not enforceable while a
   legal challenge progresses.
 * This stay is due to expire on May 26, 2023.

## General Safety

Some innocuous activities (wearing gender-affirming clothing in public
in any context that could be seen as "entertaining" whether or not for
compensation or in public) may be seen as violating the drag ban, should
the stay be lifted or a judgment supporting the state occur. Thus,
future travel should check on the state of that ban when planning
travel.

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools without explicit
"opt-in" by parents.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
