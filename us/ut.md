# USA - Utah

Utah has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.

Utah does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).

Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from Utah's
and may lack some protections.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Utah non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people in public
   accommodations (it does include LGBT people in employment and
   housing).

## Public Accommodations

 * Utah has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Utah
 * However, at least one city (St. George) is using an obscure city
   ordinance to block permits for a drag event. This is being challenged
   in court.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically be housed with men.
 * Trans men are typically be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized in limited ways.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.

Utah allows gender marker changes on IDs in some circumstances.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
   However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
   providers). While the law itself does allow for the possibility of
   hormone treatment of trans youth, in theory, the provisions are
   extremely restrictive and place doctors at extreme financial risk,
   resulting in this making it effectively a ban as any Utah provider would be
   willing to take the risk of prescribing HRT or puberty blockers to
   trans youth.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
   puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
   of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
   would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
   marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
   marriages.

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
