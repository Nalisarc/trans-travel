# USA - Florida

Equality Florida, an LGBT advocacy group, has issued an advisory travel
warning for the State of Florida.

Florida has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.

Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction, although it is not yet (or
proposed to be under pending legislation) legally considered child
abuse.  Florida's youth care ban also allows the Florida courts to have
emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it is necessary in an emergency
to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or is
threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or
procedures," similar to how the courts have jurisdiction over abuse.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
   include trans people.
 * Public school (K12) employees will not be able to be disciplined
   after July 1, 2023 for using pronouns and titles associated a trans
   person's sex assigned at birth.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Florida.
 * There is a "bathroom law" in Florida that takes effect on July 1, 2023.
   This would make it a crime to use a bathroom in government facilities
   (any level of government) not associated with your assigned sex at
   birth, if anyone objected to your presence and you refused to
   immediately leave. This also covers health care facilities, massage
   parlors, jails, pharmacies, etc.
 * Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
   drag performances where minors were present.
 * Florida has a "protection of children" law that bans "lewd conduct"
   and similar activities outside of venues such as strip clubs that are
   licensed for the purpose and only permit adults. This has been
   labeled a drag ban, and depending on how courts interpret various
   phrases may or may not actually be one.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.
 
 * There is a "bathroom law" in Florida that takes effect on July 1, 2023.
   This would make it a crime to use a bathroom in government facilities
   (any level of government) not associated with your
   assigned sex at birth, if anyone objected to your presence and you
   refused to immediately leave.
 * This law would apply to airport bathrooms, so trans people and families
   should use caution connecting through Florida airports.

## Jails / Prisons

 * As of July 1, 2023, trans women must be housed with men.
 * As of July 1, 2023, trans men must be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

On July 1, 2023, Florida will define sex largely consistent with sex
assigned at birth for a large number of interactions trans travelers
may have. Birth certificates, IDs, genital configurations, etc, will
not take priority over sex assigned at birth.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults, but this is potentially at
   risk and is subject to significant restriction.
 * Nurse practitioners and telehealth providers are not allowed to
   provide HRT in Florida.
 * Medical transition for people under age 18 is illegal.
 * Medical providers can deny most care on the basis of their religious
   or ethical beliefs (emergency care is required to be provided).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Florida
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.  However, Florida's youth care ban also allows the
   Florida courts to have emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it
   is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child
   has been subjected to or is threatened with being subjected to
   sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures," similar to how the
   courts have jurisdiction over abuse.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Equity Florida has issued a travel warning for the State of Florida (the
NAACP and LULAC, a Latino advocacy organization, have also done so,
for anti-Black and anti-Latino racism).

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools.

Some state officials consider exposure of children to sexual orientation or
gender identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
