# USA - Florida

Equality Florida, an LGBT advocacy group, has issued an advisory
warning for the State of Florida.

Florida negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans people at risk. In addition, new laws, such as a
bathroom law, are in the process of being passed

Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction.

Florida legislators have proposed the use of state courts to remove custody
from parents in the event of gender transition of a child. These bills
have not passed but are currently pending (May 3, 2023).

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
   include trans people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Florida.
 * There is currently (May 3, 2023) no "bathroom law" in Florida, however
   legislation is proceeding which would create a bathroom law in
   Florida (2023 H1521) that, if passed, would take effect on July 1, 2023.
   This would make it a crime to use a bathroom not associated with your
   assigned sex at birth, if anyone objected to your presence and you
   refused to immediately leave.
 * Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
   drag performances where minors were present.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men. A pending bill, not
   yet passed, could require this of all jails/prisons in Florida if it passes.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women. A pending bill, not
   yet passed, could require this of all jails/prisons in Florida if it
   passes.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

If Florida 2023 H1521 is passed, on July 1, 2023, Florida will define
sex largely consistent with sex assigned at birth for a large number of
interactions trans travelers may have. If passed, birth certificates,
IDs, genital configurations, etc, would not take priority over sex
assigned at birth.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults, but this is potentially at
   risk.
 * Medical transition for people under age 18 is illegal.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Florida
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

Florida legislators have proposed the use of state courts to remove custody
from parents in the event of gender transition of a child. These bills
have not passed but are currently pending (May 3, 2023).

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 H1521 (not yet passed) - Bathroom Bill](https://legiscan.com/FL/text/H1521/id/2764723)

## General Safety

Equity Florida has issued a travel warning for the State of Florida.

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity up to grade five in schools. A bill that would ban this
at higher grades is currently under consideration as of May 3, 2023.

The State considers exposure of children to sexual orientation or gender
identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
