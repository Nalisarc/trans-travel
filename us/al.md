# USA - Alabama

Alabama has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

Alabama does criminalizes trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody. However, this is currently stayed by judicial
order pending ongoing legislation.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Alabama non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, namely
   Birmingham and Montevallo.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Alabama.
 * Alabama has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Alabama does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
   people under 18 has passed and became law, but there is currently a
   judicial stay preventing enforcement of this law for puberty blockers
   and hormone therapy.
 * Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are criminalized, although
   there is currently a judicial stay preventing enforcement of this
   law for puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
   for children is illegal, in a law entitled the "Alabama Vulnerable
   Child Compassion and Protection Act."  This law is blocked from
   enforcement (for the puberty blocker and hormone therapy aspects)
   by court while litigation proceeds, but shows the state's view of
   this care.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 5 in schools.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
