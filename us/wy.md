# USA - Wyoming

Wyoming does have some negative laws towards trans people.

Wyoming is not a "sanctuary state", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Wyoming non-discrimination law does not include trans people.
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.
 * Gillette engaged a special prosecutor to investigate librarians for
   obscenity charges related to LGBT material in the public library.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Wyoming as a whole (but is in some municipalities).

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Wyoming does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * Gillette, Wyoming's library cancelled a children's event that was to be
   performed by a transgender woman.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men, but in some cases can be
   housed with women, at least on paper, at the state level.
 * Trans men are typically housed with women, but in some cases can be
   housed with women, at least on paper, at the state level.
 * Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at
   birth.
 * Wyoming in 2009 was arguing in court for the housing of intersex people
   in administrative segregation, however a judge did determine that this
   was a violation of the prisoner's 14th Amendment rights.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized in Wyoming.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Wyoming does not have a "sanctuary" law.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Wyoming does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
   transition-related medical care.

## Relationship Recognition

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Many areas of the state are extremely right-wing (such as Gillette) and
people in those locations strongly oppose trans people. Many Wyoming
residents tend to side uncritically with more extremist Republican
positions. In particular, some Gillette residents have shown willingness
to aggressively express hatred towards trans people. Jackson and Laramie
tend to be more progressive (by Wyoming standards).

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
