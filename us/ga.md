## General Safety

Georgia has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using hormone replacement therapy.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

However, there are visible LGBT communities in some cities (Atlanta,
Savannah) which may have some degree of safety.  However this is
in-spite of the law, not because of the law. Atlanta's leaders, in particularly,
has given [public support to trans
people](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/atlanta-mayor-dickens-transgender-community-funding)
