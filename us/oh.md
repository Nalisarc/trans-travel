# USA - Ohio

Ohio does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly,
although a trans woman was charged (and found not guilty) for changing
in a locker room.

Ohio does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Ohio non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms, although at least one trans woman has been charged with
   indecent exposure for using a locker room (she was found not-guilty).
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Ohio, although some counties and municipalities
   do protect it.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Ohio does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Several relatively recent (as of 2023) court cases have involved
   trans women who have been mistreated in jail and/or denied
   appropriate medical care.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized for most purposes, although they
can obtain birth certificates with an "X" marker (but not driver's
licenses or ID cards). Some county judges have denied birth certificate
changes to trans people, indicating bias within the Ohio legal system.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * Ohio has a religious exemption law that allows providers to deny some
   medical services.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Ohio and Ohio's political subdivisions have shown willingness to
extensively prosecute and litigate against trans people in court.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
