# USA - Montana

Montana has several negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.

Montana does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Montana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity, including Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Missoula, and Whitefish.

## Public Accommodations

 * Montana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.
 * School students will not be able to be disciplined for using
   pronouns associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth or their
   legal name..

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * A pending bill (2022 HB359, not yet law as of May 12, 2023) would ban
   drag storytime in schools and libraries.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Montana has a definition of sex largely in line with sex assigned at birth
would be included in nearly all Montana law (for example, Montana's
on-the-books-but-not-enforceable-due-to-SCOTUS anti-gay marriage law was
amended, as well as nearly every other law in Montana that references
sex.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.

Montana does not generally allow changing of ID.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
   However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to
   medical providers)
 * Medical providers can deny non-emergency care on the basis of their
   religious beliefs or conscious.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
   puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

White supremacists and anti-trans hate groups have been known to show up
at LGBT events in Montana. For instance, on May 20, 2023, a white
supremacist transphobic hate group [attacked attendees](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/05/21/bozeman-pride-marred-by-white-supremacy-anti-lgbtq-groups/)
at Bozeman Pride.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
