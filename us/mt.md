## General Safety

White supremacists and anti-trans hate groups have been known to show up
at LGBT events in Montana. For instance, on May 20, 2023, a white
supremacist transphobic hate group [attacked attendees](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/05/21/bozeman-pride-marred-by-white-supremacy-anti-lgbtq-groups/)
at Bozeman Pride.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
