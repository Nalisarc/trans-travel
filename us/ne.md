# USA - Nebraska

Nebraska has some negative law towards trans people. However, this
law is, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.

Nebraska does not currently, as of May 12, 2023, ban trans care for
children.  However, a bill, 2023 LB574 is progressing which would, if
enacated, ban trans youth medical care and which has an unknown impact
on child custody, although it should be noted that the law applies to
medical providers and not parents.

## General Safety

Nebraska has seen very widely publicized hate crimes against LGBT
people.  While these crimes may occur anywhere, and most anti-LGBT hate
crimes, even of the severity of the notorious crimes committed in NE,
are not publicized when they occur (and, again, can and do occur nearly
everywhere in the USA), this may be a concern to some travelers.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
