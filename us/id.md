# USA - Idaho

Idaho has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

Idaho does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody. However, this is currently stayed by judicial
order pending ongoing legislation.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Idaho non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Idaho.
 * Idaho has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Idaho has a law that prevents all levels of government from enforcing
   any bathroom non-discrimination laws upon businesses and organizations
   that contract with government. (Example: homeless shelters,
   businesses that contract with the state, private schools that get
   state money, etc).
 * Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
   but it is unclear how that is reconciled with state law.

Enforcement of school bathroom regulations is unclear.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Currently, no ban on drag performance

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are usually housed with men
 * Trans men are usually housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * While the state lost a lawsuit and was required to provide gender
   confirmation surgery to a prisoner, it should be expected that
   medical care will be sub-par. The state also aggressively fought to
   deny care, and would be expected to do so in the future.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws define sex essentially in line with sex assigned at birth.

Non-binary people are not generally recognized (with minor exceptions).

Intersex people have some recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Trans medical care is illegal for anyone under 18, including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.
 * There is a pending [legal challenge](https://www.acluidaho.org/en/news/idaho-families-sue-block-idahos-ban-health-care-trans-youth)
   of the state's youth trans healthcare ban.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Most trans medical care is illegal youth in Idaho (puberty blockers,
   hormones, surgeries are illegal)
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Idaho has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy.

Organized hate groups have attempted to riot and potentially use
violence against LGBT events.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
