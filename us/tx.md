# USA - Texas

Texas has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws could place trans visitors at risk.

It is important for parents of trans kids to research the current state
positions towards trans healthcare before a trans child visits Texas.
Texas does criminalize trans care for children through executive order
and legal opinion by the state's attorney general, as well as pending
(but not yet signed as of May 20, 2023) legislation, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children to be child abuse. The state has shown willingness to
investigate families solely on the basis of a child's gender transition
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Texas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Texas.
 * Texas has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Texas does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * A bill pending governor signature, SB12, uses vague language to ban
   "sexually oriented performances" where a child might be able to view
   it and may be used against drag performers. If passed, this would take
   effect on September 1, 2023.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men.
 * Trans men are typically housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at birth.
 * Texas considers "genital status" a key factor in housing decisions.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Texas does not recognize non-binary gender.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Medical transition for people under age 18 is subject to child abuse
   investigations under executive orders, which are being challenged
   with some success. Under attorney general opinion, medical transition
   of youth is consider abuse.
 * A pending bill (awaiting the governor's signature as of May 30, 2023)
   which would ban puberty blockers, HRT, and surgery for trans youth
   with few exceptions. This bill's enforcement actions are targeted
   primarily towards healthcare providers.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is potentially illegal under current executive
   orders and legal opinions by the attorney general and may be made
   illegal under pending law.
 * The executive order instructs child services agencies to investigate
   transgender children in many circumstances, placing custody at risk.
 * The executive order and legal opinion of the AG is being challenged
   in court.
 * The pending bill would penalize healthcare providers, but not parents
   (but it would co-exist with the executive order and legal opinion of
   the Attorney General).
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions.
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * Note that the State's "Romeo and Juliet" law which provides exception
   to some statutory rape laws where a minor is involved (if the partner is
   within 3 years of age of the minor) does not apply to same-sex
   partners. It's unknown how Texas will determine gender, although in
   past cases regarding marriage, Texas jurisdictions have arrived at
   different conclusions for trans people.

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation
in schools.

The State has shown a willingness to investigate parents of transgender
kids, including subjecting them to different processes than are applied
for child abuse investigation (such as providing less of a paper trail).
People with transgender children should research the current status of
these laws in detail before traveling to Texas.

Cis women who do not look stereotypically female in a citizen's eyes
(regardless of actual appearance) have been [harassed](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/self-appointed-bathroom-cop-catches-dallas-woman-using-womens-restroom-8259104)
and [kicked out](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/pdio76/dragged_out_of_bathroom/#)
of bathrooms by police or citizens.  In most cases, this is done with men
(police, citizens, etc) entering the women's bathroom, demanding ID, and
regardless of offered ID then kicking the woman out. In particular,
All women's bathroom users, trans or cis, who are sometimes read as men
(or do not present stereotypically femininely) should use caution.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
