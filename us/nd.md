# USA - North Dakota

North Dakota has several negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

North Dakota does criminalizes trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * North Dakota non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when visiting public educational dormitories
 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms associated with their sex
   assigned at birth when visiting jails, prisons, youth correctional
   centers, etc.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Exposure of prosthetic genitals, breasts, or buttocks, partial or
   completely, during "performance" (does not need to be paid) is
   illegal. I.E. seeing the top part (above nipples) of prosthetic
   breasts may be criminal. These do not need to be attached to a human
   to be illegal (I.E. Truck Nutz may be illegal now). This applies in
   public and in any space where minors may be.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Bathrooms and showers are required to be legally segregated by sex
   assigned at birth in state jails and prisons
 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under
   18, with some exceptions for people currently receiving care prior to
   the enactment of HB 1254 (2023) -- but only for those procedures they
   were receiving prior to enactment.
 * It is a criminal act in North Dakota to supply HRT or puberty
   blocking medication to most trans minors, which may have implications
   for people traveling with trans children on puberty blockers or HRT.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
   puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery is considered illegal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

 * [2023 HB1333 - Ban on Display of Prosthetic Gentials/Breast/Buttocks](https://legiscan.com/ND/text/HB1333/id/2785668)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
